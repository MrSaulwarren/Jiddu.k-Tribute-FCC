            <p>Krishnamurti is regarded globally as one of the greatest thinkers and religious teachers of all time.
            From the time of his break with the Theosophical Society in 1929 (dissolution speech) until his death in
            1986, Krishnamurti spoke throughout the world to large audiences and to individuals about the need for a
            radical change in mankind.</p>
