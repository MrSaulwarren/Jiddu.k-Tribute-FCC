    <blockquote><P>" To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when
      there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself "</P></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>" Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention,
      totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any
      system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive to the system,
      and that is not attention "</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>" A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of
      any kind is really a free, a peaceful man "</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>" There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination,
      and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the
      moment you die, is a process of learning "</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>" You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you
      must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and
      dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life "</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>" What religion a man holds, to what race he belongs, these things are not important;
      the really important thing is this knowledge: the knowledge of God's plan for men.
      For God has a plan, and that plan is evolution "</p></blockquote>

      Krishnamurti is regarded globally as one of the greatest thinkers and religious teachers of all time.
      From the time of his break with the Theosophical Society in 1929 (dissolution speech) until his death in
      1986, Krishnamurti spoke throughout the world to large audiences and to individuals about the need for a
      radical change in mankind.</div>
