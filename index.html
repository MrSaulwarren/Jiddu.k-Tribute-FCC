          <blockquote>
            <p>" Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive
              to the system, and that is not attention "</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p>" You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that
              is life "</p>

              For God has a plan, and that plan is evolution "</p>

            Krishnamurti is regarded globally as one of the greatest thinkers and religious teachers of all time.
            From the time of his break with the Theosophical Society in 1929 (dissolution speech) until his death in
            1986, Krishnamurti spoke throughout the world to large audiences and to individuals about the need for a
            radical change in mankind.</div>
